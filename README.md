Recommendation System using Collaborative filtering 

Using the movie lens data set, I have tried to make a recommendation system using Collaborative filtering (associate mining), as taught by Andrew Ng. 

At this point, the recommendations aren't working correct. Please help me by contributing or connecting with me.

I myself wrote a small list of Hindi movies and generated a data of Movie and user mapping using movie genre and user type.
Example - If a user likes romantic movies, then it rates a romantic genre movie with 3-5, otherwise 1 or 2. Generated the 
dataset through dataGeneration.java and used it in recommend.java. The code working on my made custom dataset has
been commented. The present code works with movie lens dataset.
